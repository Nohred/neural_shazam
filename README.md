# neural_shazam
A web app that mimics Shazamâ€™s functionality using a neural network to identify songs from a database of 50 tracks. Built with Python (TensorFlow/Keras) and a Flask backend, it processes audio fingerprints in real time and matches them against pre-trained embeddings. The frontend lets users record or upload clips to detect songs instantly.
